# LineageOS Apps 13 Extract
System tools and apps extracted from LineageOS, if you like the built-in applications of LineageOS, or the ROM you are using does not come with a certain application, you can download these and install them instead.

## If these things infringe the rights
#### If these things infringe the rights of LineageOS, crDroid or developers, please let me know and I will delete it immediately.
The reason I unpacked these is because I think LineageOS's built-in applications are the few that are stable and have strong compatibility, and are used to supplement the functions missing from some ROMs (such as the recorder).

## About the security of these apps
The ROM I unpacked is from crDroid which i has been used: https://sourceforge.net/projects/xiaomi-13-roms/files/A13/crDroid/
If you are still worried, you can go to ApkMirror or use tools to unpack it yourself.

#### Tools I Used: (may can be ur reference?)

## Compatibility
In theory, these apps can be installed on almost any ROM running Android 13 or higher. I've installed them on OneUI running Android 14 and AOSPA running Android 15, and they seem to work fine.
However, please note that apps like the voice recorder may not work properly on some ROMs, as some ROMs don't have certain features these apps require (I'm not sure).

## Finally
Anyway, have a good day and wish you happy ^^
